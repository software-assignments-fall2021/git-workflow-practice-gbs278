#Solidity Intro!
Read this [Intro to Solidity](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-solidity/)!


This article starts off by talking about solidity's connection and use in blockchains (such as the ethereum blockchain) and solidity's similarity to javascript. 
Essentially, solidity helps uses create smart contracts for anyone to use! 
This article caught my attention because it helps readers understand the future and development of blockchain technology. 
Thanks to solidity, computer science students such as myself can find a way to develop smart contracts rather quickly due to our knowledge coding from school.
However, there are no barriers to entry -- so anyone can pick up on this pretty easily!
